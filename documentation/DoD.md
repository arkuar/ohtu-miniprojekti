# Definition of Done (first draft)

We hereby agree that the following criteria should be met before a user story may be declared "done":

- Acceptance criteria for the user story are met
- Each task related to the user story has been planned and implemented
- The code builds without errors
- Unit tests for each task related to the user story are written and fully automated
- All unit tests are passing
- Some behaviour-driven (Cucumber) tests are written
- All written behaviour-driven tests are passing
- The user story has been integrated to the system

Should the criteria not be met, either the whole user story or its incomplete tasks will remain in progress.
